## Overview

### neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com integrated scripts for Python 3.5.2 and Theano with CUDA support

These scrips are updated ones from the **neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com** gitHub repository in order to work with Python 3.5.2

The testing file (**test.py**) contains all three networks (network.py, network2.py, network3.py) from the book and it is the starting point to run (i.e. *train and evaluate*) them.

## Just type at shell: **python3.5 test.py**

In test.py there are examples of networks configurations with proper comments. I did that to relate with particular chapters from the book
